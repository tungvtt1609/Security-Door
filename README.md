# Raspberry Pi Smart Door Lock
This <a href="https://www.electromaker.io/contest/connectivity" target="_blank">award-winning</a> project combines a Raspberry Pi, a MySQL database, an RFID reader, an LCD touchscreen, a relay switch, an electronic door strike and a Twilio SMS account to create the "ultimate" Raspberry Pi smart door lock security system - with "three factor" authentication. 

It's not quite true three-factor authentication, as two of the pieces are "something you have"... but it's still 3 hoops to jump through to gain access.

In this repo you will find the Python code required as well as the MySQL database table setup.

Why on earth would you want to require an RFID fob, followed by a PIN entered on the touchscreen, followed by yet another one-time code sent to you via SMS? Well, mainly for the fun of building it! There are also many applications where this might be useful for either an external or an internal door, or even on a cupboard or safe. Just make sure you build in some fail-safe overrides if you use this in the real-world!

The video below shows a demonstration of the finished system and an in-depth tutorial of how to build and configure it. I hope you enjoy it, and please give the video a thumbs-up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/SwitchedOnNetwork?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">subscribe</a> to the YouTube channel.
